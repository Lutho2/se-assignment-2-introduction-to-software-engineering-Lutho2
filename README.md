# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles,methods, and tools to develope and maintain high quality software systems. It differs from traditional programming because it involves not just writing code,but also requirement analysis,design,testing,and maintenance.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

1. Requirement: Gathering and documenting user needs.
2. Design: Creating and designing of the  software architecture amd user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to design.
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure software meets quality standards and functional.
5. Deployement: Releasing the software to users.
6. Maintenance: Updating and fixing issues in the software.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

The Agile model is interactive and incremental, allowing more flexibilty,collaboration, and responding to change. Good for long-term projects. The Waterfall model is more a sequential approach with distinct phases.It is better for short-term projects.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirement engineering is the process of defining,documenting, and maintaining the requirements in the software developement lifecycle. It is importantbecause it ensures that the software meets the needs of the user and stakeholders.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity is the division of software into smaller,manageable and independant modules. It improves maintability by allowing individual modules to be updated without affecting others and scalability by enabling the additions of new features with minimal impact on existing modules.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components.
2. Intergration Testing: Testing the interaction between components.
3. System Testing: Testing the complete system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing: Verifying that the system meets the requirements.

Testing is crucial in software developement because it helps identify and fix bugs,ensuring that the software functions as required.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are tools that help manage changes to a source code over time. They are important for collaborating,tracking change and maintaining the history of a project. Examples include Git (features: branching,merging and distributing version control.) and Subversion(SVN).

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

A software project manager oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects.

Key responsibilities include:

*Resourse management
*Scheduling
*Risk management
*Communication with stakeholders

Challenges include:

*Managing scope
*Budget
*Team dynamics

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance involves updating software to fix bugs,improve performance or adapt to new enviroments.

Types of mainatance:

*Corrective - fixing bugs
*Adaptive - modifying software to work in new enviroments
*Perfective - enhancing features
*Preventive - improving future mainatability

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Ethical issues:
*Data privacy
*Security
*Intellectual property rights 
*Ensuring that software is used for ethical purposes.

Software engineers should adhere to the ethical standards by following guidelines, being transparent with users and prioritising user safety and privacy.
